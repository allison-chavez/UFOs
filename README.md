# UFO's

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to help Dana create a website, (UFO Finder)[file:///Users/AllisonChavez/UFOs/index.html], that would be easy for users to maneuver and get more in-depth insight to UFO sightings. I created a website using different tools in order to scrape and filter out specific data such as city, state, country, date, and shape. Moreover, refactored the module code to filter out data with “enter” and not have to click a button. 


### Tools
-	Javascript
-	Html


## Results
The website is user friendly and all the information within the website is accessible with a click of the "enter" button on your keyboard. 
When you first arrive to the website you will see the main header and a paragraph for the users. Shown below are the images of the webpage upon arrival.

In order, to perform a search all a user has to do is enter in the information they are looking for, more specifically the city or date or even country. The website allows the user to narrow results as much as they'd like with the information provided. The search bars have a template of what they can fill in that search bar as well. Once the information they're want is in the search bars then they can press enter and the results will show in the dashboard. 

Below are images of a filtered search after requesting that dates UFO sightings, the dash board shows the information it has acquired.

## Summary
Drawback:
- The webpage is not as interactive and the information provided is limited, you want to make it more interactive so that there can be more user activity.

Recommendations:
- We can insert a text box for the user to have either comments on the information found in the website to make it interactive.
- Create a text box to have questions or request for more specific information that can be scraped, therefore the web page can have more content.
